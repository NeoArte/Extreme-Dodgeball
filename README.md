# Extreme-Dodgeball
This is a game project where the core idea is that it only needs a minimum number of different buttons (for the PC it's solely based on mouse inputs) and tries to bring the feeling of playing dodgeball, but with some tweaks, it's main feature being that your own ball can hurt you that way hit your enemy is the goal, but puts you in risk.
